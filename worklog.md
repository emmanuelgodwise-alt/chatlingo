### Work Summary

**Files Created:**

1. **`src/lib/webrtc.ts`** — WebRTC Peer Connection Manager
   - `getLocalStream(includeVideo)` — Gets microphone (and camera for video) with echo cancellation, noise suppression
   - `createPeerConnection(callbacks)` — Creates RTCPeerConnection with Google STUN servers (stun.l.google.com:19302, stun1, stun2)
   - `createOffer()` / `createAnswer()` — SDP offer/answer creation with local description set
   - `setRemoteDescription()` / `addIceCandidate()` — Remote peer handling
   - `toggleLocalAudio()` / `toggleLocalVideo()` — Mute/unmute controls
   - `closePeerConnection()` — Full cleanup of connection, local stream, and remote stream
   - `isWebRTCSupported()` — Browser capability check

2. **`src/lib/speech.ts`** — Speech Recognition & Synthesis Utilities
   - `LANGUAGE_BCP47_MAP` — Maps all 24 ChatLingo languages to BCP-47 codes (e.g., English→en-US, French→fr-FR, Yoruba→yo-NG)
   - `getBCP47Code(language)` — Language code converter
   - `startRecognition(language, onResult)` — Continuous speech recognition with interim results, auto-restart on silence/end
   - `stopRecognition()` — Cleanup
   - `speak(text, language)` — TTS with best available voice matching (prefix + exact match fallback)
   - `queueSpeak()` — Speech queue management
   - `stopSpeaking()` — Cancel all pending speech
   - `loadVoices()` — Async voice loading for browsers that load voices lazily

3. **`src/app/api/translate/route.ts`** — Real-time Translation API Endpoint
   - POST `/api/translate` — Accepts `{ text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage }`
   - Uses z-ai-web-dev-sdk for translation, optimized for real-time call use (temperature 0.3, max_tokens 200)
   - Same-language shortcut returns text directly
   - Proper error handling with 400/500 responses

4. **`src/components/chatlingo/call-screen.tsx`** — Full WhatsApp-style Call Screen
   - **Ringing (Outgoing) screen**: Dark green gradient (#075E54→#064E46), large avatar with pulse/ping animations, "Calling..." with spinning loader, language pair indicator (flags + labels), end call button (#D32F2F)
   - **Incoming Call screen**: Same gradient, pulsing ring animations on avatar, "Incoming Voice/Video Call" text, "ChatLingo will translate your conversation" subtitle, Decline (red) + Accept (green #25D366) buttons
   - **Connected Call screen**: Voice calls show large avatar + duration timer; Video calls show remote video full-screen + local video PIP; live subtitles bar (semi-transparent black/40 backdrop blur with original text in white/40 and translated text in white with Globe icon); call controls: Mute, Speaker (voice), Video toggle (video), End call; translation badge showing "English → French" with spinning "Translating..." state

5. **CSS Animations** added to `src/app/globals.css`:
   - `.animate-fadeIn` — Scale + opacity entrance animation (0.3s)
   - `.animate-slideUp` — Slide up + opacity animation for subtitles (0.3s)

**Files Modified:**

6. **`src/lib/store.ts`** — Added call state to Zustand store
   - New types: `CallSubtitle`, `CallPartner`
   - State: `isInCall`, `callType`, `callStatus`, `callPartner`, `callConversationId`, `callMyLanguage`, `callTheirLanguage`, `callSubtitles[]`, `callMuted`, `callSpeakerOn`, `callVideoEnabled`, `callDuration`, `callTranslationPending`
   - Actions: `startCall()`, `receiveCall()`, `answerCall()`, `rejectCall()`, `endCall()`, `setCallStatus()`, `addCallSubtitle()`, `setCallMuted()`, `setCallSpeakerOn()`, `setCallVideoEnabled()`, `setCallDuration()`, `setCallTranslationPending()`
   - Subtitle auto-pruning: keeps last 5 entries max

7. **`mini-services/chat-service/index.ts`** — Added 6 call signaling Socket.io events
   - `call-offer` — Forwards SDP offer to callee, handles offline callee gracefully
   - `call-answer` — Forwards SDP answer to caller
   - `call-reject` — Notifies caller of rejection
   - `call-end` — Notifies other party when call ends
   - `ice-candidate` — Relays ICE candidates between peers
   - `call-translation` — Server-side translation of speech text, forwards translated result to target user

8. **`src/components/chatlingo/chat-area.tsx`** — Wired call buttons
   - Video button now calls `startCall({ type: 'video', ... })`
   - Phone button now calls `startCall({ type: 'voice', ... })`
   - Both disabled when already in a call (`isInCall`)

9. **`src/components/chatlingo/chat-interface.tsx`** — Complete call lifecycle management
   - Imports and renders `CallScreen` as full-screen overlay when `isInCall`
   - Socket event listeners: `incoming-call`, `call-answered`, `call-rejected`, `call-ended`, `ice-candidate`, `call-translated`
   - WebRTC initialization for outgoing calls: gets local stream → creates peer connection → creates offer → emits `call-offer`
   - ICE candidate relay between peers
   - Speech recognition auto-starts 1.5s after call connects, sends recognized text via `call-translation` socket event
   - Received translations displayed as subtitles and spoken via TTS
   - Call duration timer (updates every second)
   - Full cleanup on call end: stops recognition, stops TTS, closes WebRTC peer connection
   - Socket stored globally on `window.__chatlingo_socket` for use in CallScreen component

**Architecture:**
- Outgoing call flow: User clicks call button → store.startCall() → WebRTC init + getLocalStream → createOffer → socket 'call-offer' → peer receives 'incoming-call' → peer accepts → createAnswer → 'call-answer' → setRemoteDescription → connected → speech recognition starts → speech sent for translation → translated text received → subtitles + TTS
- Translation path: Browser SpeechRecognition → socket 'call-translation' → Server z-ai-web-dev-sdk translate → socket 'call-translated' → receiver sees subtitles + hears TTS

**Verification:**
- `npm run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- Dev log shows successful compilation with 200 responses
- Chat service running on port 3003 (confirmed with `lsof -i :3003`)
- All existing chat functionality preserved

- `LessonData` — Lesson metadata with title, category, languages, level, XP reward, exercises count, and optional progress tracking
- `ExerciseData` — Individual exercise with type (translation/fill_blank/listening/matching/speaking), question, answer, options, hint, XP reward
- `LeaderboardEntry` — Leaderboard ranking entry with user info, XP, level, streak, lessons, rank

**New State Properties Added to CallLingoState interface:**
- `learningProfile` / `setLearningProfile` — Current user's learning profile
- `learningPairs` / `setLearningPairs` — Language exchange partner pairs
- `availableLessons` / `setAvailableLessons` — List of available lessons
- `activeLesson` / `setActiveLesson` — Currently active lesson (also resets exercise state)
- `activeExercises` / `setActiveExercises` — Exercises for current lesson
- `currentExerciseIndex` / `setCurrentExerciseIndex` — Current exercise position
- `lessonInProgress` / `setLessonInProgress` — Whether a lesson is actively being taken
- `exerciseResults` / `addExerciseResult` / `resetExerciseResults` — Exercise answer tracking with auto score increment
- `lessonScore` / `setLessonScore` — Current lesson score (correct answers count)
- `showLearnSetup` / `setShowLearnSetup` — Learning setup dialog visibility
- `showLearnPairDialog` / `setShowLearnPairDialog` — Language pair dialog visibility
- `showLeaderboard` / `setShowLeaderboard` — Leaderboard dialog visibility
- `showLessonResult` / `setShowLessonResult` — Lesson result dialog visibility
- `lastLessonResult` / `setLastLessonResult` — Last completed lesson result (score, total, XP, completion status)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `setActiveLesson` also resets `currentExerciseIndex`, `exerciseResults`, and `lessonScore` to 0
- `addExerciseResult` appends to results array and auto-increments `lessonScore` when answer is correct
- `resetExerciseResults` clears results, score, and exercise index together
- `activeTab` type kept as `'chats' | 'status' | 'channels' | 'calls' | 'explore'` (unchanged)
- All existing state and actions preserved exactly as-is

**Verification:**
- `npm run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- TypeScript compilation: no new errors introduced (all pre-existing errors unrelated to store changes)
- File: `src/lib/store.ts` only modified

## Task ID: 5b
### Work Task
Create the main lesson/exercise flow screen component (`lesson-screen.tsx`) for the ChatLingo Language Learning System. The component renders when a user is actively taking a lesson and supports 5 exercise types (translation, fill_blank, listening, matching, speaking), a progress bar, correct/wrong feedback animations, and a lesson completion screen.

### Work Summary

**File Created: `src/components/chatlingo/lesson-screen.tsx`** — A comprehensive `'use client'` component (~1100 lines) implementing the complete lesson/exercise flow.

**1. Progress Bar (Top):**
- Full-width green progress bar showing `currentExerciseIndex / totalExercises` with smooth CSS transition
- Exercise counter text: "3 / 8 exercises"
- Correct count indicator
- X button with AlertDialog confirmation to quit lesson (calls `setLessonInProgress(false)`, `resetExerciseResults()`, `setActiveLesson(null)`)

**2. Exercise Display Area — 5 Exercise Types:**

- **TranslationExercise** (`type === 'translation'`):
  - Shows word/phrase in target language in a white card
  - "Translate this to [nativeLanguage]" instruction
  - 4 option buttons with selection highlight
  - Correct = green border + green bg + check icon + XP animation
  - Wrong = red border + red bg + X icon + shake animation + green highlight on correct answer
  - Hint button (Lightbulb icon) reveals hint text in amber box

- **FillBlankExercise** (`type === 'fill_blank'`):
  - Sentence with `___` replaced by styled inline blank that fills with selected option
  - "Fill in the blank" instruction
  - Same correct/wrong feedback pattern as translation
  - Hint support

- **ListeningExercise** (`type === 'listening'`):
  - Large speaker button (Volume2 icon) with pulse animation when not yet played
  - "Listen and choose the correct translation" instruction
  - Uses `speak()` from `@/lib/speech` (Web Speech Synthesis) to speak question text in target language
  - Replay button after first play
  - Same option feedback pattern

- **MatchingExercise** (`type === 'matching'`):
  - Two-column layout: left words + shuffled right translations
  - User taps left word (highlights green), then taps matching right translation
  - Correct match = both items turn green with checkmark + opacity fade
  - Wrong match = red flash + shake animation on wrong item
  - Progress bar showing matches completed
  - Parses `correctAnswer` format "word1:trans1,word2:trans2"
  - Auto-advances when all pairs matched

- **SpeakingExercise** (`type === 'speaking'`):
  - Shows word/phrase to pronounce with "Listen to pronunciation" button
  - "Say this in [targetLanguage]" instruction
  - Large microphone button: green when idle, red pulsing when recording, green/red for feedback
  - Uses `startRecognition()` from `@/lib/speech` (Web Speech Recognition)
  - Shows recognized text in real-time
  - Correct/wrong feedback with correct answer reveal on wrong
  - Recording indicator with red pulsing dot

**3. Bottom Bar:**
- "Show Hint" link (for exercises with hints, not matching/speaking)
- "Check" button (green, disabled until option selected, disabled during feedback)
- Matching shows instruction text instead of Check button
- Speaking shows "Start Speaking" / "Stop Recording" buttons

**4. Lesson Complete Screen:**
- Celebration header: 🏆 (perfect) / 🎉 (passed) / 💪 (keep practicing)
- Score display with color-coded percentage
- "You got X out of Y correct!" message
- 3-column stats grid: XP Earned (Star), Day Streak (Flame), Total XP (Trophy)
- Green "Lesson Completed!" badge when score ≥ 70%
- "Continue" button → quits lesson (returns to learn tab)
- "Try Again" button → resets results and restarts from exercise 1
- Submitting state with spinner during API call
- Calls `setShowLessonResult(true)` with result data for parent result dialog

**5. State Management:**
- Reads from store: `activeLesson`, `activeExercises`, `currentExerciseIndex`, `learningProfile`, `token`, `lessonScore`
- Uses store actions: `addExerciseResult()`, `resetExerciseResults()`, `setCurrentExerciseIndex()`, `setLessonInProgress()`, `setActiveLesson()`, `setLearningProfile()`, `setLastLessonResult()`, `setShowLessonResult()`
- On completion: POSTs to `/api/learn/submit` with `{ lessonId, answers }` array
- Updates `learningProfile` with response data (XP, streak, level, lessons completed)
- Local state resets on exercise change (selection, feedback, recording, matching)
- Cleanup: stops recognition and speech on quit

**6. Animations & Visual Polish:**
- XP floating animation (+XP pill) on correct answer using `animate-slideUp`
- Shake animation on wrong answers via Tailwind `animate-[shake_0.4s_ease-in-out]`
- Pulse animation on mic button while recording
- Fade-in on lesson complete screen
- Smooth progress bar transition (500ms ease-out)
- WhatsApp green theme throughout (#25D366, #075E54, #E7FCE3, #D9FDD3)
- Large touch-friendly buttons (py-3.5, min 48px height)
- Exercise type badges with emoji and color-coded backgrounds

**7. Utility Functions:**
- `parseMatchingPairs()` — Parses "word1:trans1,word2:trans2" format into Map
- `shuffleArray()` — Fisher-Yates shuffle for matching right column
- Sub-components extracted for each exercise type for maintainability

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors related to lesson-screen.tsx
- `npm run lint` — zero errors, zero warnings
- All imports resolved: store, shadcn/ui (Button, AlertDialog), speech utilities, lucide-react icons

## Task ID: 5a
### Work Task
Create the main Learn Tab component (`src/components/chatlingo/learn-tab.tsx`) — the learning dashboard that shows when a user clicks the "Learn" tab in navigation.

### Work Summary
Created `src/components/chatlingo/learn-tab.tsx` — a comprehensive, WhatsApp-themed learning dashboard component with the following sections:

**1. Header Bar** — Green `#075E54` background with `GraduationCap` icon, "Language Exchange" title, Trophy (leaderboard) and Settings (setup) buttons using `wa-shadow-header` and hover:bg-white/10 effects.

**2. Welcome Screen (no profile)** — Shown when no learning profile exists:
- Animated globe illustration area with floating emojis (🗣️📚✨) using `animate-bounce`
- "Start Your Language Journey" heading with descriptive text
- Green "Get Started" button → calls `setShowLearnSetup(true)`
- "Already set up? Learn with a friend" link → calls `setShowLearnPairDialog(true)`

**3. Profile Stats Card (profile exists)** — Grid of 4 stat cells (🔥 Streak, ⭐ Total XP, 📚 Completed, 🏆 Best Streak) with dividers. Below: Level badge (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), target language flag indicator, and XP progress bar with gradient fill to next level threshold.

**4. Learning Partners Section** — Lists partner cards with avatar, name, "I learn/I teach" language flags, and "Chat" button. "Add Partner" button in header. Max height with scroll. Transforms raw API pair format to store's `LearningPairData` type.

**5. "Need a Partner?" Prompt (no pairs)** — Green gradient card with Users icon, description, and "Find a Partner" button.

**6. Lesson Categories Section** — Tab filters (All/Vocabulary/Phrases/Grammar) with category icons (📖💬📝). Grid of lesson cards, each showing:
- Category icon with colored background (blue/purple/amber)
- Lesson title with line-clamp-2
- Level badge (green/yellow/red) + 3 difficulty dots + XP reward + exercise count
- Progress: green checkmark for completed, score bar for in-progress, best score/attempts display
- Hover effects with border color change and shadow
- Click handler fetches full lesson detail from `/api/learn/lessons/[id]`, sets store state for active lesson/exercises/inProgress

**Helper Functions:**
- `getLevelLabel(level)` — Maps 1/2/3 → Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- `getLevelColor(level)` — Returns bg/text/dot colors per level
- `getNextLevelThreshold(xp)` — Calculates progress toward next level (0→100→500 XP thresholds)

**API Integration:**
- On mount: fetches `/api/learn/profile` (GET, JWT auth) for profile + pairs
- If profile found: fetches `/api/learn/lessons?targetLanguage={lang}` for lesson list
- `handleStartLesson` fetches `/api/learn/lessons/{id}` for exercises + progress
- Uses store token for all `Authorization: Bearer` headers
- Loading states: full-page spinner on initial load, inline spinner for lessons

**Style Guidelines Followed:**
- WhatsApp color palette (#075E54, #25D366, #D9FDD3, #ECE5DD, #E9EDEF, #F0F2F5, #111B21, #667781, #8696A0)
- Tailwind CSS classes throughout, responsive layout (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2)
- Custom scrollbar (scrollbar-thin), max-h with overflow-y-auto
- Smooth transitions, hover/active states
- Bottom spacing for mobile nav (h-16 md:hidden)

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors in learn-tab.tsx
- `npm run lint` — zero errors/warnings
- Dev server compiles successfully with 200 responses

## Task ID: Color Theme Overhaul
### Work Task
Complete Color Theme Overhaul — replace ALL colors across the entire project with the new Deep Teal & Lemon Green palette.

### Work Summary
Performed a comprehensive audit of all hex colors across the entire `src/` directory using `rg` to identify every color occurrence. Found that the majority of the new palette had already been applied in a prior pass, but identified 5 remaining inconsistencies where old/intermediate colors still needed to be migrated.

**New Color Palette (final):**
- Primary: `#0F4C5C` (deep teal)
- Header light: `#134E5E`
- Dark teal gradient endpoint: `#0D4D47` (replaces `#064E46`)
- Accent: `#84CC16` (bright lemon green)
- Accent hover: `#65A30D`
- Accent light: `#ECFCCB`
- Text primary: `#0A0A0A`
- Text secondary: `#525252`
- Text muted: `#A3A3A3`
- Chat bg: `#F8FAFC`
- Sent bubbles: `#ECFCCB`
- Received bubbles: `#FFFFFF`
- Input bg: `#F1F5F9`
- Borders: `#E2E8F0`

**Color Audit Results:**
- Searched for all 16 old colors listed in the migration spec (`#C45B28`, `#A04920`, `#E8DDD3`, `#FAF6F1`, `#F5F0EA`, `#E2D9CF`, `#1C1917`, `#78716C`, `#9CA3AF`, `#E7FCE3`, `#FFFDF9`, `#FFEEBA`, `#41525D`, `#1A6B7A`, `#064E46`, `rgba(196, 91, 40,`) — **none found** (already replaced)
- Searched for all old WhatsApp colors (`#075E54`, `#25D366`, `#D9FDD3`, `#ECE5DD`, `#128C7E`, `#111B21`, `#667781`, `#53BDEB`, `#E9EDEF`, `#F0F2F5`, `#DFE5E7`) — **none found** (already replaced)
- Ran comprehensive hex color inventory across all 29 component files + globals.css

**Remaining Changes Applied (5 fixes in 4 files):**

1. **`src/components/chatlingo/call-screen.tsx`** (4 changes):
   - `hover:bg-[#1EBE57]` → `hover:bg-[#65A30D]` — Accept call button hover now uses correct accent hover color
   - `to-[#134E5E]` → `to-[#0D4D47]` — Ringing screen gradient endpoint (line 170)
   - `to-[#134E5E]` → `to-[#0D4D47]` — Incoming call screen gradient endpoint (line 274)
   - `to-[#134E5E]` → `to-[#0D4D47]` — Connected call screen gradient endpoint (line 389)

2. **`src/app/globals.css`** (1 change):
   - `#134E5E 100%` → `#0D4D47 100%` — Auth gradient dark endpoint in `.wa-auth-gradient`

3. **`src/components/chatlingo/status-viewer.tsx`** (1 change):
   - `#134E5E 100%` → `#0D4D47 100%` — Emerald status gradient dark endpoint

4. **`src/components/chatlingo/spotlight-card.tsx`** (1 change):
   - `#134E5E 70%` → `#0D4D47 70%` — Spotlight card gradient dark transition

**Colors Intentionally Kept (not in migration spec):**
- `#D32F2F` / `#B71C1C` — Red for danger/end-call buttons (2 files)

## Task ID: T1-T2
### Work Task
Redesign Chat Interface with contacts as left sidebar, fix navigation issues (empty Status/Calls tabs, dialog close behavior, FAB menu).

### Work Summary

**TASK 1: Redesign Chat Interface — Contacts as Left Sidebar**

**1. `src/components/chatlingo/chat-interface.tsx` — Major layout redesign:**
- **BUG FIX**: Added missing `useState` import (was used but not imported — would crash at runtime)
- Removed unused `Sidebar` import (component no longer used in chats tab)
- Added FAB (Floating Action Button) menu with MoreVertical/X toggle button in contacts panel header
- FAB menu includes 6 actions: New Contact, New Group, New Channel, Start Room, Broadcast, Language Exchange
- Added click-outside-to-close overlay for FAB menu (fixed z-40 invisible overlay + z-50 menu)
- Passed `isActive` prop to ContactItem based on `activeConversation?.otherUser?.id === contact.id`
- Enhanced contact search to filter by both name AND preferred language
- Removed redundant non-chats-tab back button overlay (each tab has its own header with back navigation)
- Contacts panel layout: 300px fixed width on desktop, full-screen on mobile with chat replacing on contact click
- All existing WebSocket, call, and tab switching logic preserved unchanged

**2. `src/components/chatlingo/contact-item.tsx` — Redesigned contact cards:**
- Added `isActive` prop to main `ContactItem` component (previously only on `ContactItemCompact`)
- Added colorful left border accent (3px) using name hash palette of 12 pastel Tailwind colors (border-l-emerald-400, border-l-sky-400, etc.)
- Active state: bright `#ECFCCB` background + `#84CC16` left border + green side indicator bar + shadow
- Inactive state: `border-l-transparent` default with colorful hover border from hash
- Country flag emoji displayed more prominently at `text-base` size (16px) next to name
- Online/offline status indicator: green `#84CC16` dot for online, gray `#A3A3A3` dot for offline (both with white 2px border)
- Online/offline text labels: green "online" or gray "offline" below language name
- Hash-based color system: `getHashColor(name, palette)` generates consistent per-name colors from 3 palettes (borders, backgrounds, avatars)
- Compact card design with proper `min-w-0` text truncation for narrow sidebar

**3. `src/components/chatlingo/empty-chat-state.tsx` — Updated for new layout:**
- Updated welcome text: "Click on a contact from the left panel to start" (was "sidebar")
- Updated chat bg color from `#F1F5F9` to `#F8FAFC` for subtler right-panel background
- Reduced logo size from w-24 to w-20 for better fit in right panel
- **Status Tab (`EmptyStatusTab`)**: Complete redesign:
  - Added `#0F4C5C` teal header bar with "Status" title and green "Create Status" Plus button
  - Added `StatusBar` component (horizontal scrolling stories from `/api/status`)
  - Added prominent green "Create Status" CTA button in empty state area
  - Retained helpful empty state text and encryption notice
- **Calls Tab (`EmptyCallsTab`)**: Already well-designed with phone/video icons, kept as-is

**TASK 2: Fix Navigation Issues**

**2a. Status tab fixed:**
- Was showing a bare `EmptyStatusTab` without any status functionality
- Now shows: header bar → StatusBar (horizontal scrolling stories with My Status, contact statuses, Add button) → empty state with create button
- Users can now view and create statuses from the status tab

**2b. Calls tab:**
- Was already showing proper content (PhoneOff icon, helpful text, voice/video call icons)
- No changes needed — already functional

**2c. `showCreateRoom` in store:**
- Already existed in store (lines 224-225 of store.ts) — no fix needed
- Confirmed working with FAB menu integration

**2d. "More options" button fixed:**
- Added MoreVertical/X toggle button to contacts panel header
- Wired to open FAB menu with 6 action items (New Contact, New Group, New Channel, Start Room, Broadcast, Language Exchange)
- Each menu item uses colored icon circles matching the sidebar FAB menu style

**2e. Dialog close behavior fixed:**
- `src/components/chatlingo/create-status-dialog.tsx`: Added `onClick={() => setShowCreateStatus(false)}` on backdrop + `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` on inner dialog to prevent click-through
- `src/components/chatlingo/create-group-dialog.tsx`: Same backdrop click-to-close pattern
- `src/components/chatlingo/create-room-dialog.tsx`: Same backdrop click-to-close pattern
- `src/components/chatlingo/create-channel-dialog.tsx`: Same backdrop click-to-close pattern
- `src/components/chatlingo/add-contact-dialog.tsx`: Already uses shadcn Dialog component which handles this natively via `onOpenChange`

**Files Modified (7 files):**
1. `src/components/chatlingo/chat-interface.tsx` — Layout redesign, FAB menu, isActive prop, search enhancement
2. `src/components/chatlingo/contact-item.tsx` — Complete redesign with hash-based colors, isActive, online dots

6. `src/components/chatlingo/create-room-dialog.tsx` — Backdrop click-to-close
7. `src/components/chatlingo/create-channel-dialog.tsx` — Backdrop click-to-close

**Verification:**
- `npx next build` — ✓ Compiled successfully in 6.1s, zero errors, zero warnings
- All 27 static pages generated successfully
- All 40+ API routes registered correctly
